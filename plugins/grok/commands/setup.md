description: Check whether the local Grok CLI is ready and optionally toggle the stop-time review gate
argument-hint: '[--enable-review-gate|--disable-review-gate]'
allowed-tools: Bash(node:*), Bash(npm:*), AskUserQuestion

Run:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/grok-companion.mjs" setup --json $ARGUMENTS
```

If the result says Grok is unavailable:
- Tell the user to install the Grok CLI from xAI and make sure `grok` is on PATH, then rerun this command.
- Do not attempt to install it yourself.

Output rules:
- Present the final setup output to the user.
- If installation was skipped, present the original setup output.
- If Grok is installed but not authenticated, preserve the guidance to run `!grok`.
